## 📋 Overview

This project demonstrates how to design, provision, and operate a **production-style AWS infrastructure** using Terraform with a strong focus on **modularity**, **safety**, and **scalability**.

The infrastructure is intentionally built in **two phases**:

1. 🔨 **Non-modular implementation** - Understanding raw Terraform behavior
2. 🎯 **Fully modularized version** - Reflecting real-world DevOps practices

The final result is a **reusable, extensible Terraform codebase** that provisions multiple EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer, with secure networking, remote state management, and safe concurrent access handling.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most beginner Terraform projects stop at **"it works"**.

This project was built to go further and answer harder questions:

- ❓ How do you manage Terraform at scale?
- ❓ How do teams avoid state corruption?
- ❓ How do you pass data safely between resources and modules?
- ❓ How do you design infrastructure so it can evolve without rewrites?

### 🎖️ Project Goals

The goal was not just to deploy resources, but to design infrastructure that is:

- ✅ **Modular** - Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ **Reusable** - DRY principles applied
- ✅ **Secure** - Production-grade security patterns
- ✅ **Team-safe** - State locking and remote backend
- ✅ **Production-aligned** - Real-world best practices

## 🏛️ Architecture

### AWS Components

| Component | Purpose | Icon |
|-----------|---------|------|
| 🌐 **Default VPC** | Network foundation | ![VPC](https://img.shields.io/badge/VPC-FF9900?style=flat&logo=amazonvpc&logoColor=white) |
| 🔀 **Multiple Public Subnets** | High availability across AZs | ![Subnet](https://img.shields.io/badge/Subnets-FF9900?style=flat&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white) |
| ⚖️ **Application Load Balancer** | Traffic distribution | ![ALB](https://img.shields.io/badge/ALB-FF9900?style=flat&logo=awselasticloadbalancing&logoColor=white) |
| 🎯 **Target Group** | Instance-based routing | ![TG](https://img.shields.io/badge/Target%20Group-FF9900?style=flat&logo=amazonaws&logoColor=white) |
| 💻 **6 EC2 Instances** | Web server fleet | ![EC2](https://img.shields.io/badge/EC2-FF9900?style=flat&logo=amazonec2&logoColor=white) |
| 🔒 **Security Groups** | Network access control | ![SG](https://img.shields.io/badge/Security%20Groups-DD344C?style=flat&logo=amazonsecuritylake&logoColor=white) |
| 🪣 **S3 Backend** | Terraform state storage | ![S3](https://img.shields.io/badge/S3-569A31?style=flat&logo=amazons3&logoColor=white) |
| 🔐 **DynamoDB Table** | State locking mechanism | ![DynamoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/DynamoDB-4053D6?style=flat&logo=amazondynamodb&logoColor=white) |

### 🔄 Traffic Flow

```
🌍 Internet
    ↓
⚖️ Application Load Balancer (HTTP)
    ↓
🎯 Target Group
    ↓
💻 EC2 Instances (Nginx web servers)
```

> 🛡️ **Security Note**: Only the ALB is exposed to the internet. EC2 instances accept traffic **only** from the ALB security group, not from the internet.

---

## ⭐ Key Features

### 1️⃣ Modular Terraform Design

```
📦 Infrastructure split into independent modules:
├── 💻 EC2 Module
├── 🔒 Security Group Module
└── ⚖️ Load Balancer Module
```

Each module:
- ✨ Has a clear responsibility
- 📤 Exposes only required outputs
- 🚫 Avoids hidden dependencies

> 💡 This mirrors how Terraform is used in real teams.

---

### 2️⃣ `for_each` Instead of `count`

Resources are created using **`for_each`** with maps instead of `count`.

**Why?**
- ✅ Stable resource addressing
- ✅ Safer updates
- ✅ Easier association with other resources
- ✅ Deterministic naming and identity

---

### 3️⃣ Security Group Isolation

Instead of using open CIDR rules everywhere:

```
🌐 Internet → 🔓 ALB Security Group (0.0.0.0/0)
                    ↓
              🔒 EC2 Security Group (ALB SG only)
```

This dramatically reduces attack surface and reflects **real production security practices**.

---

### 4️⃣ Remote State with Locking

Terraform state is stored in:

- 🪣 **S3** - Remote backend
- 🔐 **DynamoDB** - State locking

**Prevents:**
- ⛔ Concurrent applies
- ⛔ State corruption
- ⛔ Team conflicts

> ⚠️ This setup is **mandatory** in real-world Terraform usage and is often missing in beginner projects.

---

### 5️⃣ Dynamic Target Group Registration

EC2 instance IDs are exported from the EC2 module as a **map**.

The ALB module dynamically:
- 🔄 Iterates over instance IDs
- 🔗 Attaches each instance to the target group

**No hardcoded instance references. No manual wiring.**

### 🌟 Final Note

This project represents a **complete journey**:

**From non-modular Terraform** → **To production-aligned modular infrastructure**

With state safety, security, and scalability in mind.

It reflects how Terraform is **actually used in teams**, not just how it is taught in tutorials.
